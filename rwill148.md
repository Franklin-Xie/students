Hi, I'm Reilly Williams and I'm a Masters of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student. 
I got my undergraduate degree in Business Analytics and Economics from UTK and graduated in December 2019.
I had various internships in undergrad, all regarding policy compliance in some way or another.
I currently work as a Data Compliance Engineer for Disney Streaming Services (Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, Star+).
I decided to take this course because in my role as a compliance engineer I am always working with messy data, trying to understand change logs, and interpret the changes made to data by other analysts at Disney+.
