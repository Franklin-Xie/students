Hi! I am Rob Bray. I'm a senior in computer science. Over the summer, I worked in a robot lab using android studio and python to create some basic interaction activities.
My favorite things to do in my freetime are to play games and to draw. I'm looking forward to learning more about managing data this semesterðŸ™‚
