I am Daniel Maiorano. I am currently in my final semester of the MSBA program (Master of Science in Business Analytics). I'm currently working part-time
for a small consulting firm that specializes in simulation and analytics. I'm looking foward to shoring up my Python skills, as well as learning
some better coding methods.
