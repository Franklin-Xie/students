I am Grace Seaton and I'm a Masters of Science in Business Analytics student.
I earned my undergraduate degree at the University of Memphis in International Studies and Japanese in May 2020. 
I am currently working a Data Analyst intern for Aberdeen Carolina & Western Railway and am looking forward to fine tuning my data processing/cleaning skills.
