My name is Marc Muszik (pronounced 'music'), and I'm a graduate student working towards a Masters of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)  from the Haslam College of Business. I was an Accounting major in undergrad and decided I did not want to be an accountant; my collateral was in Business Analytics, and so I came back to school for a degree in Business Analytics. My programming skills are strongest with R, but I am wanting to make my strongest skill Python. I have some experience with numpy/padas, but I still heavily rely on StackOverflow for most of the code I write. I want to become more fluent in the language and see how data engineering/analysis is done in the college of CS.
