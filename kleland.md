I am Kellen Leland and I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I am a non-traditional student who worked in the insurance industry for 10 years (catastrophe adjuster) before deciding to come back to school for something I am passionate about. I enjoy board games, video games, mountain biking, and taking my dog (Jed) on walks with my wife (Shana) who is a graduate student at UT studying clinical mental health counseling.
