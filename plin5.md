I am Pei Lin, and I am a senior in computer science. I'm currently interning at Conrad, an aerospace manufacturing company, as a part of the cybersecurity team. 
I enjoy learning about number theory, cryptography, and psychology and hope to use coding and data analysis to dive deeper into those topics.
