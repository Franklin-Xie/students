Hello, I am Prachi Patel, majoring in Computer Science and I am a
graduate student. I have been working with Trimble as an intern for the
past 17 months where I mostly worked with databases and data
visualizations. My core interests are data analysis, visualization, data
mining and data modeling. I am excited to learn more and grow myself
with Digital Archeology.
