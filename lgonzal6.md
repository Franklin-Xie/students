I am Luis Gonzalez Villalobos, and I am a senior in Computer Engineering. 
Over the course of this summer, I worked in obtaining several Data Analysis 
certifications which use Python and several libraries, such as Numpy, for quick 
and easy processing of dataframes, and Matplotlib, for generation of data
visualizations which help for easy readability. I am hoping to get better and more agile using Python overall.
