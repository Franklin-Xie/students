My name is Luis A. Gonzalez Villalobos, and I am a Computer Engineering senior. Over the summer, I worked on obtaining several Data Analysis certifications
which use Python and several libraries such as Numpy for quick and easy processing of data and Matplotlib to generate several visualizations with the data that was processed.
I am hoping to get better and more agile using Python overall.
