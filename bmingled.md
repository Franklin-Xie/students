I am Brandon Mingledorff and I am in my last semester as a Computer Engineering major here at UT.
I am from Jackson, Tennessee but have lived all over the state at various times in my life.
I am interested in video games, basketball, and visual art / graphic design.
I am excited to work on a cool project this semester and to see what everyone else creates!
