I am James Hammer and I will be your GTA for this class! I am a second year grad CS student with a focus of Data Visualization and Data Visualization Systems.
At this point you could probably say I specialize in web programming (ew). I enjoy gaming (both tabletop and video), watching way too much YouTube, and of course working on my research!

You can reach me by email reguarding questions, help, or requesting TA hours any time at jhammer3@vols.utk.edu.
