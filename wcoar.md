### My name is Lillian Coar.

###### (I actually go by Lilly, though.)

I'm majoring in computer science, and I'm in my second semester of my senior year. I had made a joke about *almost* being a super senior when I was introducing myself to the class but nobody laughed. That was awkward. Outside of the usual CS hobbies of coding and compulsively installing new Linux distros every few months, I'm a musician. However, I haven’t had time to work on music despite really having an “itch” to do so. Hopefully I’ll be able to find time in the near future to write some new music.
